## Information
This is a fork of @AlbertoMGV's script and repository "ScreenResolutionChanger"(https://github.com/AlbertoMGV/ScreenResolutionChanger ). I have added the option to edit refresh rate on top of resolution, as well as adding some default .bat files for res/freq settings that are common when playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive.
## Orignal README.md below:

# ScreenResolutionChanger
Automatic screen resolution changer using QRes by Anders Kjersem. I Developed this script basically because I required to change the resolution of my screens almost daily and it was a little bit annoying going to windows settings and stuff so I decided to create this scripts, and why not share them in git? 1love.

## DefResolution.bat
Predefined resolution changer, change values in the file
## InputResolution.bat
Requires user to input the values of resolution
